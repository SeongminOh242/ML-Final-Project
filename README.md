# üé® PPG Paint Colors: Machine Learning Final Project

## Overview  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to study paint color data provided by **PPG Industries**, the world‚Äôs largest coatings company. Using PPG‚Äôs real dataset of paint colors, we explore how color model inputs (RGB and HSL) influence:  

1. **A continuous paint property** (`response`, transformed using logit).  
2. **A binary popularity outcome** (`outcome`: 1 = popular, 0 = less popular).  

The project combines **exploration, regression, classification, and interpretation**, providing a full end-to-end data science workflow.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notice**:  
- The dataset is **proprietary** and cannot be shared on GitHub, blogs, or public repositories.  
- You may share your models, preprocessing code, and methodology, but **not** the raw data, feature importance rankings, or proprietary conclusions.

## Project Tasks  

### üîé Part I: Data Exploration  
- Visualize variable distributions (histograms, density plots).  
- Examine differences in distributions across categories and binary outcomes.  
- Study correlations between inputs (RGB, HSL) and outputs (`response`, `outcome`).  

### üìà Part II: Regression  
Goal: Predict **logit-transformed `response`**.  
1. **Linear Models (`lm`)**  
   - Fit 10 variations (intercept-only, categorical-only, continuous-only, interactions, basis functions, etc.).  
   - Compare performance and visualize top 3 models‚Äô coefficients.  
2. **Bayesian Linear Models (`stan_lm`, `stan_glm`)**  
   - Fit 2 models (best from above + one alternative).  
   - Analyze posterior uncertainty on coefficients and error variance.  
3. **Predictions**  
   - Visualize predictive trends with confidence and prediction intervals.  
4. **Advanced Models with Resampling**  
   - Elastic Net, Neural Networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and 2+ custom methods.  
   - Compare models using chosen resampling scheme and metrics (RMSE, R¬≤, etc.).  

### üßÆ Part III: Classification  
Goal: Predict **paint popularity (`outcome`)**.  
1. **Generalized Linear Models (`glm`)**  
   - Fit 10 variations (similar structure as regression).  
   - Compare top 3 and visualize coefficients.  
2. **Bayesian GLMs**  
   - Fit 2 models (best + one alternative).  
   - Analyze posterior uncertainty and predictive performance.  
3. **Predictions**  
   - Visualize event probability trends with confidence intervals.  
4. **Advanced Models with Resampling**  
   - Elastic Net, Neural Networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and 2+ custom methods.  
   - Compare models on Accuracy vs ROC AUC.  

### üîç Part IV: Interpretation  
- Identify best regression and classification models.  
- Determine most important inputs (RGB vs HSL features).  
- Explore hardest and easiest to predict paints.  
- Visualize predictive surfaces for combinations of Lightness & Saturation.
